\usage{
cca(X, k, control = ccacontrol(...), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A n by m data matrix containing preference rankings, in which there are n judges and m objects to be judged. Each row is a ranking of the objects which are represented by the columns.}

\item{k}{The number of cluster components}

\item{control}{a list of options that control details of the \code{cca} algorithm governed by the function
\code{ccacontrol}. The options govern maximum number of iterations of \code{cca} (itercca=1 is the default), the algorithm chosen to 
compute the median ranking (default, "quick"), and other options related
to the consrank algorithm, which is called by \code{cca}}

\item{\dots}{arguments passed bypassing \code{ccacontrol}}
}
\value{
An object of the class "cca". It contains:
\tabular{lll}{

clc\tab \tab  cluster centers\cr
oclc \tab \tab cluster centers in terms of orderings\cr
idc\tab  \tab crisp partition: id of the cluster component associated with the highest membership probability\cr

consrankout \tab \tab complete output of rank aggregation algorithm, containing eventually multiple median rankings

\description{
K-Median Cluster Component Analysis, a distribution-free soft-clustering method
for preference rankings.
}
\details{
The user can use any algorithm implemented in the \code{consrank} function from the \pkg{ConsRank} package. All algorithms allow the user to set the option 'full=TRUE' 
if the median ranking(s) must be searched in the restricted space of permutations instead of in the unconstrained universe of rankings of n items including all possible ties. 
There are two classification uncertainty measures: Us and Uprods. "Us" is the geometric
mean of the membership probabilities of each individual, normalized in such a way that
in the case of maximum uncertainty Us=1. "Ucca" is the average of all the "Us".
"Uprods" is the product of the membership probabilities of each individual, normalized in such a way that
in the case of maximum uncertainty Uprods=1. "Uprodscca" is the average of all the "Uprods".
